## HR-Bot
This Telegram bot retrieves and stores employee Chat IDs for HR use. It runs as a server, collecting IDs when users interact with it. These IDs can be used in systems like TrueTabs to send automated notifications via Telegram API. The bot itself does not send messages, only retrieves IDs. ðŸš€


## Overview
This is a Telegram bot designed to retrieve employee Chat IDs. It allows the HR system to send notifications about leave approvals, disapprovals, new task assignments, and other important updates using Telegram API.

## Features
Retrieves employee Chat IDs via Telegram bot.
Stores Chat IDs in a text file for later use.
Can be integrated with external systems like TrueTabs for automated notifications.

## How It Works
The Python script (cybernauts.py) acts as a server, retrieving and storing Chat IDs when users interact with the bot.
These Chat IDs are stored in chat_ids.txt.
The TrueTabs HR system includes a button in relevant sheets (e.g., leave requests, task assignments) that triggers a Telegram API request.
When pressed, the button constructs a URL request that sends a formatted notification to the respective employeeâ€™s Telegram account


## Telegram API Request Format
The TrueTabs button triggers a URL request structured as follows:
https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/sendMessage?chat_id={Chat_ID}&parse_mode=HTML&text=
<b>New Task Assigned</b>%0A%0A
<b>Task ID:</b> {Task_ID}%0A
<b>Task Name:</b> {Task_Name}%0A
<b>Assigned To:</b> {Assigned_To}%0A
<b>Priority:</b> {Priority_Level}%0A
<b>Start Date:</b> {Start_Date}%0A
<b>Deadline:</b> {Deadline}%0A%0A
{Comments}
